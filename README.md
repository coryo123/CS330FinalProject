The project has helped me take a more methodical approach and appreciate linear algebra a bit more when it comes to terms with creating the vertices and how it helps to shape the 3D shapes. The strategies helping me with this project were the previous modules and milestones that helped to create a basis and learn knowledge little by little that would help to create the overall scene. This class and the graphics and visualization overall just helped me in gaining more knowledge with coding and how it can help shape other aspects of my computer science goals, giving me other aspects to understand that I can implement to my future career.
